Â I feel valued when people make recommendations I feel comfortable with, take the time to explain to me if I don't follow what is being recommended, checks in with me periodically (even twice a year is fine) to let me know if we need to do some portfolio balancing or changing of investments. Â That my advisor was willing to sit with me over a brown bag lunch at his desk was great. Â  Â Just chatting a bit I think he was tuning in to some of my concerns or life style issues that might arise in near future. Â (Example, what large expenses did I anticipate... like new car.... Â I'd even forgotten mentioning it to him, but he raised it again in a subsequent meeting to see if it was time to sell off some investments to get me the cash I might need for the purchase.) Â I never felt rushed, but also never felt that our conversations were time wasting for either one of us. Â \nÂ \nWe were similar in age (new advisor is younger... but that's not surprising since I'm retirement age+) and although closeness in age with advisorÂ may have made me more comfortable, I also have felt that when working with assistants and now with new advisor, that I was being treated respectfully and like I had a brain in my head. Too often over the last few yearsÂ I have noticed the gray haired (especially women) are treated as if they can't possibly follow what is being said... or are spoken to in catch phrases and jargon that don't mean anything to anyone who has achieved more than 25 years on this planet. Â  I have never felt that at NW. Â Ever. Â  Â People spoke to me in terms I could understand and explained things if I didn't catch on immediately. Â  I'm not a dolt (IÂ have two graduate degrees) and I really really hate it when I'm talked down to simply because I don't use emojis and twitter to communicate. Â Stand in line sometime... you'll see middle aged women often become invisible to sales people (and are seen as cranky old poops when we speak up when we have been ignored so someone younger can be assisted). Â Â  Â It simply has never been an issue with NW personnel... from the receptionist all the way up the line ... Â people are friendly, helpful, and respectful.

I know the DOW settled down a week or so later, but the first day after the voting and the market tanked, my representative should have been on the phone doing proactive outreach. There should be key messages, even if it's \"don't worry, things will settle down as more information becomes available.\" Same thing around the presidential election time...I'd like to hear from my representative about how the change would be expected to impact my account. I'd like to see proactive outreach with a purpose via emails or phone calls/phone messages..... Something that tells me my representative is looking at my account and doing something about it. Another example is today, the news is that AT&T stock is falling. I have stock in AT&T....why isn't my representative calling me to tell me what's going on? I have to read this stuff online. I pay this person alot of money annually and I'd like to see some tangible service provided to me. I'd also like to see no fees paid by me if my account doesn't make any money. And it hasn't made any money for nearly 2 years. I have less in my account now than I did when I started with NML. It's very troubling for me to pay significant fees when my account performance is poor. I can see sharing the wealth (so to speak) when money is being made, but if the representative isn't helping me, why should I pay him/her? I absolutely don't feel as thought I'm getting value from NML. The only thing that provides comfort is that I think NML has a solid reputation, but my recent experiences are showing me that maybe I made a mistake in having NML handle my money.Â ","allTags":"","agrees":"0","starredInd":"No","postDate":"07/07/2016 01:30:00 PM"}

Like \"I want to put a $50,000 addition on my house.\" In response: \"OK, here are three ways to do that. If you want to take the savings approach, we should set up this account for you, which I can do, to keep you from spending the money.\" It sounds dumb and simple, but those kinds of things would be very helpful.","allTags":"","agrees":"0","starredInd":"No","postDate":"07/05/2016 04:32:00 PM"}
